# custom-styled-home-page

For use with a home page replacement extension for chrome or firefox (or a browser of your choosing) such as:
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/new-tab-redirect/icpgjfneehieebagbmdbhnlpiopdcmna


## Usage
Drop these files anywhere in a filesystem so long as they are in the same folder.

Add .jpg images to the same folder with the naming convention "number.jpg". Eg: 1.jpg, 2.jpg, 3.jpg and so on. The script will randomly cycle through these pictures each time you open the file. Alternatively, just have a file named 1.jpg if you would like only 1 background.

In the JavaScript section of the HTML file the headings and subheadings will have to be manually edited to have custom text there.


## To do
